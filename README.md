# Cypress-Music-Library-Lab

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

Automated end-to-end test scripts for a music library application using Cypress. The tests simulate a typical sequence of user actions—from logging in through updating the music library—to validate real-world use cases and the integrity of user workflows.

---

## Features

- **Automated Testing:** End-to-end verification of user behaviors
- **White-Box Testing:** Scripting covers both UI and logic flows
- **Scripting:** Simulates clicks, form submissions, and database updates
- **User Behavior:** Replicates a realistic usage sequence for QA

---

## Technologies Used

- Cypress.io

---

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/Cypress-Music-Library-Lab.git
    cd Cypress-Music-Library-Lab
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Open Cypress Test Runner:**
    ```
    npx cypress open
    ```
    or run headlessly:
    ```
    npx cypress run
    ```

*For more about Cypress installation and running tests, see the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/).*

## Usage
- Launch the app you want to test.
- Open Cypress and select the desired test suite.
- Watch the tests simulate a complete user journey: login, navigation, data entry, library management, and validation.
- Review test results in the Cypress dashboard.


---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Gained experience in automated testing by scripting tests that mimic human interactions—including clicking UI elements and entering data in sequence.
- Built a deeper understanding of real user flows and how automation can improve QA reliability.

---

## Future Improvements

- Extend test coverage to simulate longer user journeys and cover edge cases.
- Add more sophisticated keystroke combinations and test complex scenarios for deeper usability insights.
